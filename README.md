<img src="Salary_Pic.PNG" width="1100" height="300"/>


## 1. Problem Statement
Companies often face a problem of over spending on new hires. And having prior knowledge of the salaries estimation of the new employee will be beneficial not only for employee but also company. As we know over spending to hire new employee would negatively impact the financial health of the company. 

## 2. Goal
Provided job salary datasets, the goal of this project is to predict the future employee salaries based on the data of current employees salaries by creating a robust machine learning model.



### Datasets
- From major online job board

### Data fields
- **jobId** - The ID of the job. <br/>
- **companyId** - The ID of the company <br/>
- **jobType** - The description of the job <br/>
- **degree** - The degree of the employee <br/>
- **major** - The education field of the employee <br/>
- **industry** - The field to which the company belongs <br/>
- **yearsExperience** -  The employee years of experience on the job<br/>
- **milesFromMetropoli** - The distance in miles, the employee lives away from his/her workplace <br/>
- **salary (target)** - Estimated Salary <br/>

### File descriptions
1. **EDA-Job Salary Prediction.ipynb** - Explore job description datasets and also provides a brief modular explaoratory data analysis. <br/>
2. **Job Salary Prediction.ipynb** - Implement the machine learning algorithm, establish the baseline model, select the best model to predict the salary on the test data. <br/>
3. **plot_job_features_.ipynb** - file which helper function to visualize features or attributes. <br/>
4. **readme.md** - This file <br/>



## 3. Descriptive Statistics

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
