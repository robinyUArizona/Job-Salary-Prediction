## 1. Problem Statement
Companies often face a problem of over spending on new hires. And having prior knowledge of the salaries estimation of the new employee will be beneficial not only for employee but also company. As we know over spending to hire new employee would negatively impact the financial health of the company. 

## 2. Goal
Provided job salary datasets, the goal of this project is to predict the future employee salaries based on the data of current employees salaries by creating a robust machine learning model.



### Datasets
- From major online job board

### Data fields
- **jobId** - The ID of the job. <br/>
- **companyId** - The ID of the company <br/>
- **jobType** - The description of the job <br/>

- **yearsExperience** -  The employee years of experience on the job<br/>
- **milesFromMetropoli** - The distance in miles, the employee lives away from his/her workplace <br/>
- **salary (target)** - Estimated Salary <br/>
